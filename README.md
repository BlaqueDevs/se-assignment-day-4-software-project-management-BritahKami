# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial because it helps avoid extra costs, keeps customers happy because they receive their services on time, helps company remain competitive and be in demand of their services.

Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by:
Setting clear deadlines for their team.
Holding meetings with their team regularly to check up on their progress.
Implementing a flexible methodology such as Agile. 
Having a plan on how to manage risks incase they occur.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control helps make a budget for the development of a software and stay within that budget, use resources wisely hence preventing wastage.

Strategies to prevent budget overruns:
Making a budget that will including all the costs that the project will use.
Keeping tabs on the expenses the project encounters.
Regularly reviewing the budget that was made and making necessary changes if needed.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
In Agile methodologies planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements while in Waterfall model it involves inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages making it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.

Advantages of Agile methodology:
It is flexible hence changes can be easily incorporated.
Featurees are added in an incremental process.
Disadvantages of Agile methodology:
It is hard to determine completion time.

Advantages of Waterfall methodology:
Development of the software follows a fixed planning process.
Management is easier because development follows a sequence. 
Disadvantages of Waterfall methodology:
It is inflexible hence changes cannot be easily incorporated.
It is costly incorporating changes after planning.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall model is appropriate for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites and where the requirements are well understood and changes will be limited during the design process for example building an accounting system for a bank while the Agile model is appropriate where frequent updates are necessary for example in game creation where features are added based on users feedback.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Testing the software regularly for example unit, integration, system, acceptance testing.
Developer reviewing his or her code to check for mistakes and correcting it.
Catching and fixing bugs earlier before they cause a bigger problem.

Importance of maintaining higher standards:
To minimize on costs because bigger problems require more money to fix them.
Leads to higher security.
Attractes customers hence creating satisfied and happy customers.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
It acts as a guide that tells us what is included in the project and what is not included hence preventing developers from incorporating features that are not
needed hence preventing extra costs and delay.
Work Breakdown Structure helps break projects into smaller tasks. This helps tasks become more clearer and easier to execute. It also helps tracking of tasks become easier.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Detailed project schedule helps in tasks priorization hence employees know what tasks to do first and which ones to do last.
It also helps in resource allocation whereby managers know which resources to allocate to a specific task. 

Gantt chart shows the dependency that exists between tasks for example coding must be done before testing.
It also shows the team's progress.
It also visualizes the tasks that should be carried out and its time of completion.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to provide guidance to form 4 leavers on which career path to choose based on their interest, kcse results, demand in the market.

Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Form 4 leavers often make poor career choices due to lack of proper guidance.
Form 4 leavers are afraid of choosing courses that will lead to unemployment.
Form 4 leavers often have limited access to information hence relying on relatives and friends.
Form 4 leavers often choose wrong career paths hence end up dropping the choosen course mid-way.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It helps in understanding what features your software needs hence helps avoid adding unnecessary features.
It helps ensure the software that is being built meets the needs of the users.
It helps in saving time and money since the problem being solved is well-defined.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Our platform is a career guide that aims to help form 4 leavers choose the best career paths for themselves based on their interests, kcse results and the demand of 
the career in the market. We aim to achieve this through incorporating interactive career quizes, access to course details and career recommendations. 
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Our software is aimed to be interactive, user-friendly and easy to navigate.
Our software aimes to provide university and college information for example courses offered and entry requirement.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Our software primary audience are form 4 leavers. The number of form 4 candidates that sat for their kcse in 2024 were 962,512. This number inceased by 7.19% compared to 2023. If 20% of the form 4 leavers use our software then each year there will be a rise in the number of students using our software.
In addition, their is also a growth potential for our software since majority of people nowadays have access to mobile devices and internet. 

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
By helping us understand our users and their preferences for example the features that they prefer.
It can help stay ahead of your competitors by offering unique features.
It helps know how to price your software for example monthly subscription.
